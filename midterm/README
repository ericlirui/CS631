1.I did implement all the parameters. but I dont have time to do the format print with same indent. I need to traverse the max length of all the output parameters. I will complete it in the future.
2.I use the double list of linux kernel implementation to do my double linked list. So. the dlist.h will include some inline functions which is by the linux implementation , not by me.
