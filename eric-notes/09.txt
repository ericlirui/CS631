Before class:


After class:
1. procedure:
1) create socket : socket
2) attach to a socket: bind
3) listen to mark socket : listen
4) accept : accept will block if no connections are available
4) read /write

2. Sockets must be removed using unlink(2)

3. Stream sockets are stateful.

HW2 comment:
- calling system(3) will not work, since you do not
get stderr; the assignment gave you very specific
instructions to use exec
- missing error checks
