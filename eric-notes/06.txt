1. Sticky set ask the program to be remained in .txt section memory which can  execute much faster next time.

2. If no return value ,the EAX register remains the value of laster statement returned or stored.

3.gdb can display those registers' value. 
Use display rip/rbp/rax etc.

4. In C89 standard, if no return function in main , it returns the original value of last statement. While in C99 standard, it implicitly return 0 for main function.

5. Atexit() is like a deconstructer to register before the main exit.

6. Malloc -> library function
   Brk -> system call.
 
7. Alloca -> allocate memory on stack 
   Calloc -> initiate the memory to zero.

8. Process can only change the soft limit of the resource. To change hard limit need higher permission.

9. Fork also copy the IO buffer and pass it to the  "cat" command, then it flush the IO buffer out to the screen
