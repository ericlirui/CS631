How to traverse the directories efficiently?

After class:

1. Pwd -> getcwd().
   Cd -> chdir().

2. Directory are social files containing hard links.

3. Directory links count will increase create a new directory under it.

4. /.  
    ..  for / , .., ., is the same node number in file system

5. Link is removing the map between  the file and node number and reduce the link count

6. Don't ulink it if the file has been opened.

7. Better to traverse directories using FTS interfaces. see fts(3).
