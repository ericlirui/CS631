Before class:
1.Can I change the c_time of file?

After class:
1. Ln -l / tmp bacon : just create a link, which does not matter if the file exists.

2. For the homework1 , the cp command should check st_dev in stat structure as well.

3. For the hole file, the real blocks it occupy are much smaller.

4. mkfifo is likely to create a new pipe, just like the command pipe [|].

5. We can use lstat to get the attributes of the link.

6. Ls -l /dev/fd | cat

7. Set_uid specify the owner of a file, the setuid() function should only use elevated privileges when needed.

8. Remove file only matters with the directory permission, if the directory have write permission (w+x), it can be removed even it has not owned this file.

9.umask, note that the bit on the mask is to turn off in the file mode

10. Sticky bit : even other have perms, when it set, only owner can remove it.



Homework1 comments:
- archive and directory not named after your username;
should be rli36, not ruili

- please follow the style guide:
- sort includes
- spaces around clauses

- you can't strcat to a buffer you haven't allocated
and know to be large enough

- don't print output the program didn't require:

fprintf(stderr, "\n");

- instead of using opendir(2) to determine if a path
is a directory, use stat and S_ISDIR

- incorrect check for same file:

if(s_src.st_size == s_dest.st_size &&
s_src.st_ino == s_dest.st_ino){

you need to compare st_dev, not st_size

- better to use O_TRUNC to open(2) than

if(0 != ftruncate(fp[1],0)){

- rather than specifying fixed permissions, use the
st_mode from the source

- your program allows invocation as
./bbcp file1 file2 file3 file4
