Before class:
What is the difference between dynamic share library and static library ?

After class:
1. Lockfiles must be removed by exit handlers otherwise restarted daemons will not run since the lockfile will still exist.

2. Read elf header content : readelf -h a.out

3. Hexdump -C a.aout

4. List all the program header : readelf -l a.out

5. ar : make an archive 

6. C Library cannot be overwritten but library loading order can be exploited.
