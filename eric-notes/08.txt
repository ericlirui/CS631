Before class:
1. What is the advantage between IPC and pipe?

After class:
1. System V IPC : For shared memory , the kernel and the process only only interact 2 times, while the msg queue should interact at least 4 times.

2. ipcs -m : shared memory identifier
   ipcs -c : semaphore idntifier.
   ipcs -q : message queue information

3. Order of parent /child processes cannot be determined, in the  example has child blocking so the parent execute first.

4.The kernel will prevent malloc from overwriting shared memory.

5.system v ipc 
 1) communicate between unrelated processes 2) kernel structures 3) fast but not popular

PIPE
1) communicate between related processes 2)kernel structures 3) slow with half-duplex 4) complex but universal.

6.  Man Mkfifo
