Before class:
How to see the content of the core file?


After class:
1. Some vid marks need to remember:  
   Move multiple files, :n, :prev, :rew

2.use ctagsto fast look-up in your code .

3.Compiler process:
  1) preprocess : cpp files
  2) compilation : cc
  3) Assembly: As
  4) Linking : ld tool
  
4. Core files are snapshots of the executable at the time of a segmentation fault. 
We can gcc with the core files and the bin file together to debug problems.

5. Makefile:
   ${PROG}:${OBJS}
	${cc} ${CFLAGS} ${OBJS} -o {PROG}

Homework1 notes:

1.See sysconf, setrlimit , limits , to get to know pre-defined constants in your system.

2.Avoid code duplication

3.Don't strcat with argv[]. For big memory, we should first malloc a space and then copy or strdup it.
